1. Write a program in Python to allow the error of syntax to be handled using exception handling.
HINT: Use SyntaxError

Ans.def error_handling():
    try:
        eval('a===b')
    except SyntaxError:
        print("syntax error raised.")

error_handling()


2. Write a program in Python to allow the user to open a file by using the argv module. If the
entered name is incorrect throw an exception and ask them to enter the name again. Make sure
to use read only mode.

Ans.import sys

def file(nam):
    try:
        if sys.argv[0] == nam:
            with open(nam, 'r') as f:
                f.read()
        raise FileExistsError("Enter file name again: ")

    except FileExistsError:
        raise

   inp= input('Enter your file name:')
   file(inp)

3. Write a program to handle an error if the user entered a number more than four digits it should
return “The length is too short/long !!! Please provide only four digits”

Ans.def four_digits(num):
    try:
        if num >= 10000:
            raise ValueError(f"{num} number is too long.")
        elif num < 999:
            raise ValueError(f"{num} number is too small.")
        print(num)
    except:
        print("Please provide only four digits number.")
        raise
        
four_digits(eval(input('enter a number: ')))

4. Create a login page backend to ask users to enter the username and password. Make sure to
ask for a Re-Type Password and if the password is incorrect give chance to enter it again but it
should not be more than 3 times.

Ans.def login_page():
    try:
        username = input("enter your username: ")
        password = input("enter your password: ")
        re_password = input("please re-enter your password: ")
        i = 0
        while i <= 2:
            if password == re_password:
                print('welcome: ',username)
                break
            elif password != re_password :
                print("your password is wrong. ")
                re_password = input("please re-enter your password: ")
            i +=1
            if i == 3:
                raise TypeError("session out.")
            
    except TypeError:
        raise

login_page()

6. Read doc.txt file using Python File handling concept and return only the even length string from
the file. Consider the content of doc.txt as given below:
Hello I am a file
Where you need to return the data string
Which is of even length
Make sure you return the content in The same link as it is present.

Ans.def file_handling():
    with open('doc.txt','w') as f :
        f.write("Hello I am a file\nWhere you need to return the data string\nwhich is of even length")
        f.write('\nMake sure you return the same link as it is present')
    with open("doc.txt") as f:
        temp = ""
        for i in f:
            wordlist = i.split()
            #print(wordlist)
            for j in wordlist:
                if len(j) % 2 == 0:
                    temp = temp + " " + j
        
        print(temp)
