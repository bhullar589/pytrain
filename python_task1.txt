1. Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of
them belongs to a different data type.
E.g. :
a = 1,
b = 2.01,
c = 'string'

Ans. a,b,c=5,0.9,'string'

2. Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.

Ans. a= 1+2j
     b=5
     a, b= b, a

3. Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.

Ans.  a=5
      b=33
      c=a
      a=b
      b=c

      a=2
      b=8
      a,b=b,a

4. Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x
Version.

Ans.  x=raw_input("enter a value")
      print(x)
      x=input("enter a value") 
      x

5. Write a program to complete the task given below:
Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in
another variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the
final output.


Ans. x,y=input("enter two values")
     z=x+y
     result=z+30
     result

6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc

Ans. x=input("Enter a value")
     print("The data type of the input value is : ",type(x))

7. Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and
UPPERCASE.
(Refer: https://capitalizemytitle.com/camel-case/)

Ans. 	myCamelCaseVariable = 1
	my_snakecase_variable = 23     
        MyUpperCamelCase = 45
        MYUPPERCASEVARIABLE = 21

8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

Ans. Yes, variables in Python can be reassigned to a new value that is a different data type from its current value.When you assign it a value, 
the box will contain that value, and when you reassign it, it will empty out the old value, and the new value will be placed inside of it.
